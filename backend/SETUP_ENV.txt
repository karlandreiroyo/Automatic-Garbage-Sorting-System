INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE .env FILE:

1. In the 'backend' folder, create a new file named exactly: .env
   (Make sure it starts with a dot: .env not env.txt)

2. Copy and paste this content into the .env file:

SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

3. Replace 'your_service_role_key_here' with your actual Service Role Key:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to: Settings > API
   - Copy the "service_role" key (the long secret key)
   - Paste it in place of 'your_service_role_key_here'

4. Save the file

5. Restart the backend server:
   npm start
