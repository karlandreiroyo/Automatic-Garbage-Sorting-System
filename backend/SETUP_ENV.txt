INSTRUCTIONS TO CREATE .env FILE:

1. In the 'backend' folder, create a new file named exactly: .env
   (Make sure it starts with a dot: .env not env.txt)

2. Copy and paste this content into the .env file:

SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

3. Replace 'your_service_role_key_here' with your actual Service Role Key:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to: Settings > API
   - Copy the "service_role" key (the long secret key)
   - Paste it in place of 'your_service_role_key_here'

4. Save the file

5. Restart the backend server:
   npm start

DEPLOYMENT (e.g. Railway) — add these so routing works from your deployed frontend:

BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
   - Public URL of this backend (Railway gives you this).
   - Used in emails/links and startup logs.

FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.railway.app
   - Public URL of your frontend (or Vercel/Netlify URL).
   - Backend allows CORS from this origin and uses it in password-reset links.

CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.railway.app
   - Optional. Comma-separated list of allowed origins if you have multiple frontend URLs.
   - If you set FRONTEND_URL, it is automatically allowed; use CORS_ORIGIN for extra origins.

Frontend: when building for production, set VITE_API_URL to your backend URL so all API calls go to the right place, e.g.:
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app npm run build
   (Or set VITE_API_URL in your frontend host's environment and build there.)
